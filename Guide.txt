Guide to Resurgence Modules

"city_center_(date).py"

Inputs to GIS module:

+ Shapefiles, include Urban Areas (2010), Census Tracts (2010) [path = "L:\\Research\\Resurgence\\GIS\\"]
+ Urban Area Ranking by Population (2010) [path = "L:\\Research\\Resurgence\\GIS\\"]
+ LEHD Employment data (2010) [path + "Working Files\\wac_trct.xlsx"]

(i)   UA are indexed (by c), looped through to create universe of tracts for states relevant to UA_c, projected
(ii)  LEHD built on to create shapefile for all UA_c tracts, employment density computed
(iii) Hotspot analysis run on employment density, keeping all those with G*>thresh (thres=2.58 for now)
(iv)  Boundaries dissolved among these high emp dens areas, cluster with max(G*) kept as cc cluster, centroid as cc point
(v)   City Centers defined based on cc point and clusters.

Outputs:

+ Shapefiles for CC tracts for each UA
+ Universe of tracts for each UA

"resurge_htspt.py"

Inputs to "resurge_htspt"

+ Same shapefiles and ranking as "city_center..."
+ NCDB (1970-2010, 2010 Boundaries), [NCDB_forGstar.xlsx]
 
 
(i)   UA indexed again, looped through
(ii)  NCDB mapped onto tracts tracked from "city_center...", includes only income, pop, and shr vars, generated from "ncdb_gis.do" based on full NCDB
(iii) Hotspot analysis run for each year (1970-2010) on income and shr variables (perc_white for reverse white flight computation)

Outputs:

+ G* by income and perc_white for each UA

"cc_points.do"

Inputs:

+ Spillover tract list, distance to city center list (NO SOURCE IN ARC, NEED TO CONVERT FROM QGIS) [L:\Research\Resurgence\GIS\Working Files\Output\Spillover and Distance]

(i)   Converts distance measure to miles, builds into large data set for all UA
(ii)  Keeps all spillover tracts (nearest neighbors) with distance gamma (gamma = 1 mile for now), takes means, maps back onto original tract with spill_inc variable attached

Outputs:

+ Distance to CC for each tract
+ Spillover income based on set of closest tracts (MANY DO NOT HAVE SPILLOVER)

"ncdb_gis.do"

Inputs: 

+ NCDB (full) [global ncdb = "L:\Research\Resurgence\NCDB"]

(i)  Labels variables, fixes geo codes, etc.
(ii) Generates useful NCDB variables (re-coded)

Outputs:

+ "NCDB_forGstar.xlsx" - input into "resurge_htspt.py"
+ ncdb_reg.dta - input into build of  data set for full analysis.
